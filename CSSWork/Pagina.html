    <h3>CAN SPINAL DECOMPRESSION HELP YOUR LEG; NECK OR BACK PAIN?</h3>
    <p>
Spinal decompression has become the most advanced non-surgical tool aimed at treating arm, leg, neck and back pain associated with disc herniations and degeneration.
<br>
<br>
In January 2002, Dr. Caruso was among the first chiropractors to introduce this breakthrough technology to Westchester County. Since then, DR. Caruso's Scarsdale, NY based facility, Spine Care, has established a unique precedent with the success of pre and post MRI scans, His impressive results have now inspired a large network of referring physicias and chiropractors(thogout Westchester County and Manhattan) who work ciosely with Dr. Caruso.
